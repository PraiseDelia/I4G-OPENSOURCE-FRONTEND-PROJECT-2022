THE I4G OPENSOURCE COMMUNITY CODE OF CONDUCT
----------------------------------

The I4G community is a mix of professionals and individuals working on an open source project with the aim of acheiving a particular goal. Collaboration, community governance, and support are keys to make this a successful one.

To this end, there a few ground rules to engage in the community.

This code of conduct is and will always be a work in progress as, again, community governance is key and no single authority must enforce the rules.

## The I4G community members strive to

### Be friendly and welcoming

Having an amicable attitude towards new and existing members contributes to a healthy community.

### Be patient

Be patient in sharing the knowledge, helping others, and in hearing opposing views.

### Be considerate

When proposing a change or voicing a view, think of all the work and views that other community members have.

### Be respectful

Having opposing views on anything is no excuse for malbehavior.

### Collaborate openly

Transparent and open collaboration reduces redundancy. Communicate.

### In disagreement, try to understand why

Disagreements are natural. Always strive to understand differing views and resolve disagreements constructively.

### When unsure, ask for help

Communication is key, and communication is as simple as it sounds. When you need help, ask the community.
